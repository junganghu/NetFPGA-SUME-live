 * Update 64 bit example design FIFO to correctly respond to TREADY after TLAST

2015.1:
 * Version 3.0
 * Product name changed from AXI 10G Ethernet Subsystem to 10G Ethernet Subsystem for Ethernet naming consistency across the Vivado IP catalog
 * For Ultrascale devices, use of the Async 64/66 Gearbox has enabled the clocking logic to be simplified.  txusrclk2 is now used as the clock source for the data path logic.  Please consult the Product Guide for details.
 * For Ultrascale devices, added an option to select the transceiver reference clock frequency used by the core
 * Significant round-trip (transmitter and receiver) latency reductions for 64-bit datapath permutations
 * Added 10GBASE-R 32-bit datapath options for the core to provide lower utilization and latency
 * Added an option to enable the removal of the RX elastic buffer for all Ultrascale designs, to further reduce latency and utilization
 * Added IEEE1588 timestamping support to Ultrascale 10GBASE-R permutations
 * Added support for stacked VLAN frames (QinQ) as defined in IEEE802.1ad
 * Added automatic enabling of FEC during Autonegotiation, where both link partners have FEC ability and at least one has requested FEC enablement
 * Now using the Ultrascale GT Wizard Reset Helper Block for all cores on Ultrascale devices.  The dclk input from the core must be connected to a free-running clock source for Ultrascale devices.
 * Some pins have been renamed, added and removed to support more features and be more agnostic with clock frequencies. Please consult the Product Guide for details.
 * Added rxrecclk_out port in all configurations
 * Added qpll0reset output port for Ultrascale devices to permutations that have shared logic in the example design.  This port is used to drive the the QPLLRESET input of the GT COMMON
 * Added customization options to set the frequency of DRP clock and AXI-Lite clock.
 * 7-Series 1588 permutations: connected up the reset port of the MMCM in the shared logic to the MMCM_RESET output signal from the tx_startup_fsm module to improve reset/initialization reliability.  The dclk input from the core must be connected to a free-running clock source for 1588 permutations.
 * 7-Series 1588 permutations: connected up the QPLL_RESET output port of the tx_startup_fsm module to the QPLLRESET of the GT COMMON to improve reset/initialization reliability.
 * 7-Series 1588 permutations: added txfsmreset_request output port for permutations that have shared logic in the example design. This is an OR of internal core transmitter reset sources (such as a PMA reset request).  txfsmreset_request will restart the tx_startup_fsm module to trigger a full reset and buffer bypass phase alignment of the transcevier to improve reset/initialization reliability.
 * Added a new self-contained shared logic wrapper within the example design for permutations where shared logic is included in the example design.  This will reduce the amount of file editing when adding the shared to customer projects.
 * Fixed example design FIFO to always recover cleanly after overflow conditions.
 * Example design FIFO now instantiates dedicated clock domain crossing synchronization modules to be consistent with the rest of the example design.
 * Example design transmitter FIFO enhanced to achieve full line rate performance under all operating conditions
 * Enhanced demonstration test bench to terminate immediately after successful frame reception when in DEMO_TB mode rather than waiting for a long fixed duration before self terminating.

2014.4.1:
 * Version 2.0 (Rev. 2)
 * Update to Ultrascale GT Wizard v1.5
 * 1588 permutations using the Time-of-Day format: an issue has been fixed in the receiver timestamp whereby the seconds field could occasionally be in advance by 1 second
 * Make it easier for the Auto-Negotiation Block to lock to and parse incoming data

2014.4:
 * Version 2.0 (Rev. 1)
 * The AXI-Lite state machine in the example design is now repeatedly carrying out MDIO reads until it detects block lock in non pcs-loopback mode.

2014.3:
 * Version 2.0
 * The core is now available in the Vivado IP catalog in addition to the IP integrator tool.
 * 10GBASE-R permutations are now available with or without 1588 timestamping support.
 * Added 10GBASE-KR options.
 * Added MAC Management I/F and Priority Flow Control options.
 * Added GUI option to include or exclude shareable logic resources in the core. There are port changes on the core as a result.
 * Added optional transceiver control and status ports.
 * Added optional transceiver DRP ports.
 * Added example design.

 * Supported 7-Series parts are now at Production status.
 * Increased the accuracy of the hardware timestamps for IEEE1588 support.
 * Updated the default value of the 1588 Transmitted Timestamp Adjustment Control Register: the latency adjust value is now set appropriately to adjust the timestamp point to the edge of the device, and the timestamp correction is now enabled by default.
 * Updated the default value of the 1588 RX Fixed Latency MDIO register: the latency adjust value is now set appropriately to adjust the timestamp point to the edge of the device
 * Input port default tie-off values for IP Integrator have been added to signal_detect and tx_fault and changed to logic 1 for reset_counter_done, tx_axis_aresetn and rx_axis_aresetn
 * MDIO port address has been changed from 0x01 to 0x00.

2014.2:
 * Version 1.2 (Rev. 1)
 * Fixed the transceiver reset logic in VHDL projects (Verilog projects had no issue).
 * Fixed the 1-step logic so that correctionField modification can occur in an earlier byte position within the frame.  This will allow 1-step modification of layer 2 packets in addition to IPv UDP packets.
 * Adjusted the 64-bit fractional nanoseconds field pipelining logic to ease timing closure.
 * Updated to use the latest version of the underlying xlconstant subcore, no functional changes.

2014.1:
 * Version 1.2
 * Added optional support for an alternative 1588 timer format.  This is a 64-bit fractional nanoseconds field, similar to the 1588 correctionField definition, which enables the ability to provide 1-step support for all device types (including transparent clocks).
 * Fixed issues in the transmitter UPD checksum update logic.
 * Fixed issues in the transmitter 1-step timestamp insertion logic.
 * Fixed an issue in the receiver timestamping logic where the top 16-bits of the seconds field were held at zeros.
